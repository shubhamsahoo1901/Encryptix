## üåü Introduction

Buying a house involves many challenges, including price prediction. This project aims to provide an accurate prediction of house prices using machine learning models trained on a dataset with multiple features.

## üìä Dataset

The dataset contains 13 features including:

1. `Id`: Record identifier.
2. `MSSubClass`: Type of dwelling.
3. `MSZoning`: General zoning classification.
4. `LotArea`: Lot size in square feet.
5. `LotConfig`: Configuration of the lot.
6. `BldgType`: Type of dwelling.
7. `OverallCond`: Overall condition of the house.
8. `YearBuilt`: Original construction year.
9. `YearRemodAdd`: Remodel date.
10. `Exterior1st`: Exterior covering on house.
11. `BsmtFinSF2`: Type 2 finished square feet.
12. `TotalBsmtSF`: Total square feet of basement area.
13. `SalePrice`: Sale price of the house (target variable).
